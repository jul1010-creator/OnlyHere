// ── Which published entries actually need redrafting ───────────────
// Oliver, 6 Aug 2026: "I'd also make a system so we put up a 'needs redraft'.
// Because right now I'm redrafting some. But I'm not sure which ones need. I
// don't care about the ones that was written by ChatGPT before.. that is what
// it is. But some of them might be very off."
//
// The old "Needs Redraft" panel listed the hardcoded `towns` array, which was
// emptied in PASS 29. It has been showing an empty list ever since. This
// replaces guessing with evidence.
//
// DELIBERATELY DETERMINISTIC, NO AI. Every check below is a fact about the
// stored payload that can be verified by reading it. That matters for three
// reasons: auditing 55 entries costs nothing, the same entry always scores the
// same, and the reason given is always literally true rather than a model's
// opinion about quality. An AI reviewer would be slower, cost real money, and
// produce a different answer each run.
//
// Every finding names WHAT is wrong and WHERE, so the answer is never just
// "this one looks bad".
