// ── THE ONE PLACE THE PUBLIC ADDRESS IS WRITTEN DOWN ─────────────────
// A link preview card has to name an absolute URL for its image: WhatsApp,
// iMessage and Slack fetch og:image from a separate request with no page
// context, so a root-relative path silently produces a card with no picture.
// That means the domain is hardcoded somewhere, and the day it changes is the
// day every shared guide loses its preview without a single error anywhere.
//
// So it is written down ONCE, here, and tests/run.mjs asserts that index.html's
// own og:image agrees with it. Change the domain and the test fails loudly
// rather than the cards failing quietly.
// UPDATED 10 Aug 2026 to the real domain. It had stayed on the vercel.app
// address after gemlyxtravel.com went live, and that is not cosmetic:
//
//   1. Every share card, on every guide, showed only-here-three.vercel.app as
//      the site it came from. The brand was on the page and nowhere near the
//      link somebody actually saw in WhatsApp.
//   2. index.html's canonical tag pointed there too, which tells Google the
//      vercel.app copy is the real one and the new domain is a duplicate of it.
//      That is the single most effective way to stop a new domain ranking, and
//      it is silent: nothing breaks, the site simply does not appear.

// Booking.com affiliate ID (the "aid" number from the Booking.com Partner
// Programme). EMPTY until Oliver's affiliate account is approved — the moment
// it is, paste the number here and every Booking.com link in the app (the
// per-day "Where to stay" card on GuidePage, and any future ones) becomes an
// affiliate link at once. STANDING RULE: never remove this constant or the
// links that use it — accommodation/booking links are a permanent feature and
// the app's planned revenue path, per Oliver directly (Aug 5 2026).
